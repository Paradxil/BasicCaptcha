# Basic Captcha
Basic Captcha is a simple captcha implementation in NodeJS. 

## Our Goal
Our goal was to create an easy to use captcha for use with contact forms and other low risk applications. 
This captcha was not designed to be extremely secure, but rather as a simple way to block spam form submissions.

## Use
This captcha is easy for the end user to complete and easy for developers to implement. 
Only a few lines of code are needed to add the captcha to a form and verify the captcha once submit.
Like most captchas, this captcha is not meant to be the pimary security measure for an application. 
The primary use case is to block spam submissions on contact us forms and similar applications.
